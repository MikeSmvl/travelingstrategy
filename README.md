<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

  <img style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;display: block;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/master/images/screenshot.png" alt="Logo">

There are many great travel information websites available, however, we didn't find any that had all the information you would need when traveling from point A to point B. We want to create an informative site so amazing that it would be the last one you would ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on having a good travel. No one likes to find out that they cannot board a flight because they don't have a travel visa or are missing special vaccinations.
* You should know within the first visit all the crucial information to make sure, your travel is hassle-free.
* You should be reminded of any issues before your upcoming travels.

A list of related resources that we find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
