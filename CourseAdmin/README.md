<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Summary

There are many great travel information websites available, however, we didn't find any that had all the information you would need when traveling from point A to point B. We want to create an informative site so amazing that it would be the last one you would ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on having a good travel. No one likes to find out that they cannot board a flight because they don't have a travel visa or are missing special vaccinations.
* You should know within the first visit all the crucial information to make sure, your travel is hassle-free.
* You should be reminded of any issues before your upcoming travels.

A list of related resources that we find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

<!-- RISKS -->
## Risks
Data gathering
* The importance of having enough data to be able to see valuable information for every country is a risk as some countries might not have government provided statistics. For example, Canada has a branch of the government called Statistics Canada which provides CSV files which could be parsed and displayed on our website. Other countries might not provide data which means we will need to find third party data that might not be as accurate. This leads us to the next risk:

Accuracy of data
* As the data is not static, we have to make sure that we fetch up to date data for our users and to make sure that we get our data from reputable sources. 

<!-- ETHICAL ISSUES -->
## Ethical issues
* Ethically, it is important to provide correct and accurate information, because the user will be relying on it to plan their trip. Providing the wrong travel advisory/emergency contract number can be very costly, especially in a foreign country. 

<!-- VELOCITY -->
## Velocity and iterations
### [Iteration 3](https://github.com/MikeSmvl/travelingstrategy/milestone/1) (4 stories, 19 points)
We have moved away from the Arthur.ai project and will be moving forward with Traveling Strategy from this sprint onward. The rest of the sprint was spent setting up the project (dependencies, CI, DB) and implementing a basic UI. The sprint was rounded out by parsing data to and from a json file. 

### Iteration 3 (X stories, X points)
