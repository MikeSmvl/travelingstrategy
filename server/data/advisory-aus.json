More information: Australians visiting the US (including the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico) for less than 90 days may be able to travel under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). You can\u2019t enter under the VWP if you have: Before travelling under the VWP, you must apply and be pre-approved for the VWP via the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). US authorities recommend that you apply for the ESTA as soon as you know you will be travelling there. ESTA approvals can take up to 72 hours. Approved ESTAs are valid for two years and multiple entries. If you renew your passport within the two-year period you\u2019ll need to apply for a new ESTA. Discrepancies between the ESTA, passport or ticket information could lead to you being denied entry or referred for secondary inspection (see below). \n   You also need to reapply for an ESTA if the circumstances relating to any of the VWP eligibility criteria change. If your ESTA application is denied, you\u2019ll need to apply for a visa from a US Embassy or Consulate (see below). US authorities generally won\u2019t disclose why an ESTA application is rejected and there's no scope for appeal. If you provide false or incorrect information on an ESTA you may be permanently ineligible for travel to the US. More information:\u00a0\u00a0United States Customs and Border Protection If you\u2019re ineligible to travel under the VWP or your ESTA application is denied, you\u2019ll need to obtain a visa. Visitors can apply for tourist or business visitor visas (B-1/B-2 visas), but there are visa categories for every purpose of travel. Contact a US Embassy or Consulate for further information. More information: US authorities at your port of entry decide the date until which you can legally remain in the US.\n   This may not be the same as the expiry date of your ESTA or visa. Upon entry, US authorities will stamp your passport and usually write the date you must leave on the stamp. You'll also be issued an electronic (or hardcopy) Form I-94 Entry / Departure Record. Your I-94 is evidence of your legal status in the US and also indicates the date by which you must depart. You can check your I-94 on the\u00a0US Customs and Border Protection\u00a0website each time you enter the US. If you stay beyond your I-94 expiry date, you can be detained, deported and barred from re-entering the US in future. You cannot extend or renew your I-94 by traveling to Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean for a short period of time (30 days or less) and then re-entering the US. If you have an unexpired I-94 when you travel from the US to Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean you will only be re-admitted to the US for the balance of time remaining on your original I-94. If you have a recently expired I-94 and US authorities suspect that the purpose of your trip outside the US was simply to extend your stay in the US, you can be refused entry and held until arrangements can be made for your removal. If you're issued a hard copy I-94 on arrival, you should give it to the airline, cruise line or US Customs and Border Patrol when you leave the US.
